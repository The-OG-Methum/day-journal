# Day-journal

The Day Journal API is a Spring Boot backend application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete personal journal entries with features like input validation, structured error handling, and clean separation of concerns using Controller-Service-Repository layers, while also supporting data persistence via Spring Data JPA and optional enhancements like Swagger documentation, user authentication, and response standardization.
